# Titanic
This project demonstrates comprehensive SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset.
Using MySQL, a total of 28 analytical queries were developed to extract insights about passenger survival rates, demographics, ticket fares, and embarkation patterns.

The dataset contains detailed information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features like age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival outcome. This project showcases SQL skills applied to real-world data, emphasizing data filtering, grouping, aggregation, conditional logic, and handling missing values.

🔍 Key Features
Performed SQL queries to extract detailed statistics by passenger class, gender, and survival status.

Calculated survival percentages and average age/fare based on multiple factors.

Identified demographic trends such as age distribution of survivors, high-paying passengers, and embarkation port breakdowns.

Handled missing data (e.g., unknown age values) using SQL conditions.

Used string pattern matching to filter passengers by titles like "Mr.".

Segmented passengers based on conditional logic (e.g., under 18, fare > 50, class = 1).

🧰 Technologies Used
